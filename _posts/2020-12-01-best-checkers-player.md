I just finished watching [The Queen's Gambit][queen_gambit] on
Netflix. Here are my favourite quotes from episode 5 of the series:

> "I can fight against anyone but time." - [Vasily Borgov][borgov]

> "No, it's okay. I just don't love it as much as I once did. I'm not
  obsessed with it the way one has to be to win it all." - [Harry
  Beltik][beltik]

Not so related to the topic but this series reminds me of a story of
[Marion Tinsley][tinsley], the greatest *human* checkers player in our
history[^1].  According to a very nice article by Jonathan
Schaeffer[^2], Tinsley dominated the game for 45 years by losing only
seven games from thousands; two losses were in a match that he won
against a computer program, [Chinook][chinook], in 1992. (The program
became World Champion in 1994, and the game is completely solved since
2007[^3].)
